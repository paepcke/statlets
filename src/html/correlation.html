				This chart shows the murder rates per 100k citizens
				in five US States. The green data points show the rates 
				in 1996; the blue points show the rates at 2014. Note
				the consistent difference between the two data series.
				<p>
				The Pearson's correlation <i><b>r</b></i> is shown in the upper
				left of the chart. It tells us to what degree the murder 
                rate changes between 1996 and 2014 are similar between
                the states. For example, in 1996 Alabama's rate was 
                10.4 murders/100K-citizens. By 2014 the rate had fallen
                to 5.7murders/100k-citizens. Observe the trend in the 
                other states. Then click the Step 1 button.

				To get a feel for the behavior of Pearson's <i>r</i>, move the
				data points up and down, observing the correlation measure.
				Try to arrange the data points such that <i>r=0.7</i>.
				Then arrange the points very differently, but ending up
				with an <i>r=0.7</i> again. You can click the <i>Reset</i>
				button to arrange the data into their true values as often
				as you like.
				<p>
				Observe how sensitive <i>r</i> is to moving particular points.
				do you see differences in how rapidly <i>r</i> changes when
				you move the points? Try (roughly) doubling one series, leaving
				the other data points alone. How does <i>r</i> change? What
				about when you instead add a constant to each point?
