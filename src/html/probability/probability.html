				The goal: develop intuitions about probabilities, their distributions,
				and how probabilities combine into joint probabilities. This statlet's
				underlying dataset is an excerpt from the 2013 causes-of-death counts
				across all US States (CDC: Center for Disease Control).
				<p>
				You will build a slot machine that allows you to bet on the cause
				of one or more upcoming US deaths. Each slot module of your machine
				comprises four components:
				<ul>
				  <li>A white spin-outcome window.</li>
				  <li>A set of buttons that spin the module once, 10, or 100 times in
				    a row. Each spin is one draw from the cause-of-death
				    probabilities.</li>
				  <li>A histogram of spin outcomes, and</li>
				  <li>A pulldown menu to place a bet on the next outcome.</li>
				</ul>
				The green number counts your number of wins.
				<p>
				The chart on the far right shows the probability of a heart attack
				compared to a stroke. This initial value of 0.5 for both does not
				reflect the true data. We'll get to the truth in future steps. This
				part is just to get you started. The chart shows a <i>probability
				distribution</i>: the bars show how probabilities are distributed
				across the causes of death. For now, let's assume there are only two
				ways to die. 
				<p>
				Things to do:
				<ul>
				  <li>Hit the Go buttons.</li>
				  <li>Place a bet; then spin again.</li>
				  <li>Be the casino owner (or God): lower/raise the probability bars.
				      then spin again a bunch of times.
				  </li>
				</ul>
				Things to wonder about:
				<ul>
				  <li>Add the probabilities in the distribution. What's the sum? What
				  is the range of values this sum can take?
				  <li>Observing how the histogram changes as you spin, compare its
				     shape with the shape of the cause-of-death distribution.
				  </li>
				  <li>Spin a few times, observing the histogram. Then change one of
				    the two probability bars and spin a few more times. How are
				    the changes in the histogram different before and after that
				    manipulation of the probability?
				  </li>
				  <li>When you change one of the probabilities in the distribution
				  you'll notice the other bar going the opposite direction. Why is
				  that? 
				    </li>
				</ul>
				By the way: you can drag the slot module to a convenient
				location. You'll find that you want to in a bit.
			</div>

				Let's make the machine more interesting. You now see a new button:
				<i>Add Slot Module</i>. Click it. You want to, don't you? The result
				will be a second slot module. If you didn't move the one you already
				have, the new and old modules will be on top of each other. No worries.
				
				Drag the new module to the right of the original module until the new
				module turns green. Let go of the mouse, and the two modules dock. You
				now have a two-module slot machine. You can drag it around. Note that
				you can place different bets in each module. Better than Vegas!
				<p>
				Notice the dock connector labeled <i>and</i>. It tells you that to
				win, <b>both</b> of your bets must be winners. Try it: make a bet on
				both modules. Spin a bunch. You will see the score board change only
				when both slots win.
				<p>
				You've doubtlessly noticed that a formula now appears when you slide
				the mouse over one of the slots. You recognize that formula: it
				computes the joint probability across the slot modules.
				<p>
				To wonder about (and to satisfy your boundless curiosity about
				statistics):
				<ul>
				  <li>What would happen if the <i>and</i> in the dock connector were
				    an <i>or</i>? Specifically: How would the rate of winning change?
				  </li>
				  <li>Wonder enough about it? OK, select the dock connector,
				    choose <i>or</i>, and try it out.
				  </li>
				  <li>
				    After spinning a slot a lot, driving up the bars of the module's
				    histogram, you sometimes see the Y-axis change. Why is it doing
				    that?
				  </li>
				</ul>

				Let's play with a fuller death deck. These 21 selected causes of death
				are a sample of the 5904 that the CDC lists as options for us to
				go from. One that I left out: 
				<i>Cardiovascular devices associated with adverse incidents,
				  prosthetic and other implants, materials and accessory devices</i>
				(two 2013 cases in the US).
				<p>
				The probability distribution is more complex, but nothing else
				changes. Same principles. Adding the probabilities would sum
				to...what? Adjusting a probability upwards would cause the other bars
				to do...what? Yep, same thing as in Step 1. Build as complex a slot
				machine as you wish, place your bets, and watch the win rate.
				<p>
				Now, casino patrons don't get to modify whether slots in one-armed
				bandits are coupled with <i>and</i>s versus <i>or</i>s. But casino
				owners can do anything they like, subject to gambling regulations.
				<p>
				  To wonder about:
				  <ul>
				    <li>Say you are a casino owner. Your goal is to make money
				    (i.e. to have patrons lose a lot). But you also want to ensure
				    that patrons are not discouraged. They should win some of the
				    time. Just qualitatively, how would you combine manipulating death
				    cause probabilities with <i>and/or</i> dock connector settings to achieve
				      one or the other of these goals?</li>
				    <li>
				    In a 2015 article, Healthline.com reported:
				    <blockquote>
				        New research finds that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
				        increases the risk for sudden cardiac death, even among patients
				        without major heart problems.
				    </blockquote>
				    That finding is bad news for this statlet. How does this finding
				    invalidate the application's probability calculations?
