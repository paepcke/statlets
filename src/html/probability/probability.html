The goal: develop intuitions about probabilities, their distributions,
and how probabilities combine into joint probabilities. This statlet's
underlying dataset is an excerpt from the 2013 causes-of-death counts
across all US States (CDC: Center for Disease Control).
<p>
You will build a slot machine that allows you to bet on the cause
of one or more upcoming US deaths. Each slot module of your machine
comprises four components:
<ul>
  <li>A white spin-outcome window.</li>
  <li>A set of buttons that spin the module once, 10, or 100 times in
    a row. Each spin is one draw from the cause-of-death
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>A histogram of spin outcomes, and</li>
  <li>A pulldown menu to place a bet on the next outcome.</li>
</ul>
The green number counts your number of wins.
<p>
The chart on the far right shows the probability of a heart attack
compared to a stroke. This initial value of 0.5 for both does not
reflect the true data. We'll get to the truth in future steps. This
part is just to get you started. The chart shows a <i>probability
distribution</i>: the bars show how probabilities are distributed
across the causes of death. For now, let's assume there are only two
ways to die. 
<p>
Things to do:
<ul>
  <li>Hit the Go buttons.</li>
  <li>Place a bet; then spin again.</li>
  <li>Be the casino owner (or God): lower/raise the probability bars.
      then spin again a bunch of times.
  </li>
</ul>
Things to wonder about:
<ul>
  <li>Add the probabilities in the distribution. What's the sum? What
  is the range of values this sum can take?
  <li>Observing how the histogram changes as you spin, compare its
     shape with the shape of the cause-of-death distribution.
  </li>
  <li>Spin a few times, observing the histogram. Then change one of
    the two probability bars and spin a few more times. How are
    the changes in the histogram different before and after that
    manipulation of the probability?
  </li>
  <li>When you change one of the probabilities in the distribution
  you'll notice the other bar going the opposite direction. Why is
  that? 
    </li>
</ul>
By the way: you can drag the slot module to a convenient
location. You'll find that you want to in a bit.
