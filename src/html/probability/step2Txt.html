Let's play with a fuller death deck. These 21 selected causes of death
are a sample of the 5904 that the CDC lists as options for us to
go from. One that I left out: 
<i>Cardiovascular devices associated with adverse incidents,
  prosthetic and other implants, materials and accessory devices</i>
(two 2013 cases in the US).
<p>
The probability distribution is more complex, but nothing else
changes. Same principles. Adding the probabilities would sum
to...what? Adjusting a probability upwards would cause the other bars
to do...what? Yep, same thing as in Step 1. Build as complex a slot
machine as you wish, place your bets, and watch the win rate.
<p>
Now, casino patrons don't get to modify whether slots in one-armed
bandits are coupled with <i>and</i>s versus <i>or</i>s. But casino
owners can do anything they like, subject to gambling regulations.
<p>
  To wonder about:
  <ul>
    <li>Say you are a casino owner. Your goal is to make money
    (i.e. to have patrons lose a lot). But you also want to ensure
    that patrons are not discouraged. They should win some of the
    time. Just qualitatively, how would you combine manipulating death
    cause probabilities with dock the connector settings to achieve
      one or the other of these goals?</li>

    In a 2015 article, Healthline.com reported:
    <blockquote>
        New research finds that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
        increases the risk for sudden cardiac death, even among patients
        without major heart problems.
    </blockquote>
    That finding is bad news for this statlet. How does this finding
    indict the application's work with statistics?
    </li>
  </ul>
