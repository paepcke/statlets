Let's make the machine more interesting. You now see a new button:
<i>Add Slot Module</i>. Click it. You want to, don't you? The result
will be a second slot module. If you didn't move the one you already
have, the new and old will be on top of each other. No worries.

Drag the new module to the right of the original module until the new
module turns green. Let go of the mouse, and the two modules dock. You
now have a two-module slot machine. You can drag it around. Note that
you can place different bets in each module. Better than Vegas!
<p>
Notice the dock connector labeled <i>and</i>. It tells you that to
win <b>both</b> of your bets must be winners. Try it: make a bet on
both modules. Spin a bunch. You will see the score board change only
when both slots win.
<p>
You've doubtlessly noticed that a formula now appears when you slide
the mouse over one of the slots. You recognize that formula: it
computes the joint probability across the slot modules.
<p>
To wonder about (and to satisfy your boundless curiosity about
statistics):
<ul>
  <li>What would happen if the <i>and</i> in the dock connector were
    an <i>or</i>? Specifically: How would the rate of winning change?
  </li>
  <li>Enough wonder: select the dock connector, choose <i>or</i>, and
    try it out.
  </li>
</ul>
