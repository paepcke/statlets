                          This statlet allows you to explore
                          confidence intervals. The <i>population</i>
                          are all US states. A <i>sample</i> is a
                          randomly selected group of five
                          states. The <i>measurement</i> taken on each
                          state in a sample is the rate of teen
                          pregnancies in a given state. The data was
                          collected by the US Center for Disease
                          Control (CDC). A state's teen pregnancy rate
                          is computed as the number of teen births in
                          that state, divided by the total number of
                          births in that state.
                          <p>
                          Go ahead and find the population and sample
                          means, the standard deviations, and the
                          confidence interval of this particular
                          sample.

                          Now pretend that some of these sample states
                          had different teen pregnancy rates. How would
                          that affect the confidence interval?  So see,
                          drag the bars in the sample chart up and down,
                          while observing the confidence interval. To
                          notice:

                          <ul>

                          <li>What happens to the confidence interval
                          when you make one bar much higher or lower
                          than the others? Why does this happen? (You
                          can always return to the original values by
                          clicking the <i>Reset</i> button.)</li>

                          <li>Drag one of the sample bars to the
                          height of the sample mean, and then a bit
                          above, and a bit below that line. While you
                          do this, simultaneously observe the sample
                          standard deviation number and the width of
                          the confidence interval. What do you
                          observe?</li>
                              
                          <li>Now make all the bars the same height as
                          the blue population mean line. What happens
                          to the confidence interval? What is the
                          value of the sample SD?</li>

                          <li>Next, make all the bars the same height
                          again, but below or above the blue
                          population mean line. Where does the
                          confidence interval end up?</li>

                          </ul>

                          When a confidence interval is very wide, it
                          means that the experimental results are not
                          very reliable. One way to mitigate this
                          problem is to collect more samples from the
                          population.
                          <p>
                          You can observe the effect of this move by
                          clicking the <i>Add a State</i> button. You
                          will see that an additional, randomly selected
                          state is added to the sample chart. You can
                          click this button as often as you
                          want. Observe that your confidence interval
                          does not <i>always</i> get smaller when you
                          add another state. Sometimes the additional
                          state actually makes the confidence interval
                          larger. By observing the bar added by an
                          additional state, can you articulate why this
                          negative effect might occur?
                          <p>
                          However, note what happens to the confidence
                          interval as you make your sample larger and
                          larger. Take the process to its extreme. After
                          you clicked the <i>Add a State</i> button many
                          (actually 46) times, a popup notice will
                          appear. Can you guess what this notice will
                          say?
                          <p>
                          Once you get that notice to appear, compare
                          the two mean lines. What do you notice?

                          Finally, let's relate all this to the formula
                          for confidence intervals:

                          $$ci = sampleMean \pm t_{0.95/2}*\frac{SampleSD}{\sqrt{n}}$$

                          The <i>0.95</i> indicates that this statlet
                          performs all its computations using a 95%
                          confidence interval. Remember that
                          \(t_{0.95/2}\) is the value your read from
                          the <i>t</i> distribution table.  The
                          value <i>n</i> is the size of the sample you
                          took. In our case that number is five (unless
                          you added states).
                          <p>
                          Go again through the various manipulations you
                          can perform. This time as you drag bars, or
                          add sampled states, think about which part of
                          the formula you are changing, and how those
                          changes explain what you observe.
