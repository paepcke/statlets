This statlet allows you to explore confidence intervals. The
<i>population</i> are all US states. A <i>sample</i> is a randomly
selected group of five states. The <i>measurement</i> taken on each
state in a sample is the rate of teen pregnancies in a given
state. The data was collected by the US Center for Disease Control
(CDC). A state's teen pregnancy rate is computed as the number of teen
births in that state, divided by the total number of births in that
state.
<p>
Go ahead and find the population and sample means, the standard
deviations, and the confidence interval of this particular sample.

Now pretend that some of these sample states had different teen
pregnancy rates. How would that affect the confidence interval?
So see, drag the bars in the sample chart up and down, while observing
the confidence interval. To notice:

<ul>

<li>What happens to the confidence interval when you make one bar much
    higher or lower than the others? Why does this happen? (You can
    always return to the original values by clicking the <i>Reset</i>
    button.)</li>

<li>Drag one of the sample bars to the height of the sample mean, and
    then a bit above, and a bit below that line. While you do this,
    simultaneously observe the sample standard deviation number and
    the width of the confidence interval. What do you observe?</li>
    
<li>Now make all the bars the same height as the blue population mean
    line. What happens to the confidence interval? What is the value
    of the sample SD?</li>

<li>Next, make all the bars the same height again, but below or above
    the blue population mean line. Where does the confidence interval
    end up?</li>

</ul>
